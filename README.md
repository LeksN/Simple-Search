# Simple Search
This is a very basic app. Designed for people who wants to replace the Google Search bar from the home screen with another bar, which uses their prefered search engine. 

This app contains a simple widget, which will open the app on a click. There you can use the search bar to type in a search query, which will be opend in the internet browser. 

You can change the search engine in the settings (Default is DuckDuckGo) or type in a custom search string. The app also saves the search queries as a history.

## Usage
If you want to use my work for your own project (which means in most cases: Put ads in it and publish on Google Play Store) YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE GPL LICENSE! This means, your project MUST be open source under a GPLv3+ compatible license and MUST contain attribution for the original work! I already found a lot of copies which simply removed my "About" screen and changed some graphics. If I see your work violating the GPL rules, I will let it get removed by Google. 

So please follow the rules! Use this attribution text (or a similar one)
